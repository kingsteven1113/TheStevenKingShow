Welcome to The Steven King Show.

This is my portfolio site that will also be hand coded as well.

Hello Recruiters, 

I am Steven, 22 Years Old, graduated college in 2022. I am a Front End Focused UX/UI Designer/Developer. I have a versatile skillset that you will see throughout my code and site. I would love to speak to you about the position you're looking to fill and how I can be of assistance.

Anyway, enjoy the show and please feel free to send any feedback.

For other developers,

If you're looking into my GitHub Repository to learn from my portfolio, by all means, do what you must. If you have any questions about my concepts or my code, please feel free to reach out to me. I would love to help you or if you have any constructive criticism, feel free to let me know.

Hope you enjoy the show!
